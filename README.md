# NotEditingBasisShapekey
Thanks to GPT4, I managed to create this addon that display warning text on your viewport whenever you're editing a shapekey. It's very common to mess with shapekeys and then forget which one you last worked on, to then make massive edits on the mesh only to realize you weren't editing the basis.
