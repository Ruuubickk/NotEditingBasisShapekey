# NotEditingBasisShapekey
Thanks to GPT4, I managed to create this addon that display warning text on your viewport whenever you're editing a shapekey. It's very common to mess with shapekeys and then forget which one you last worked on, to then make massive edits on the mesh only to realize you weren't editing the basis.


## Features

- Chose the text you want to display
- Control the text size
- Control the position of the text on the screen
- Change the color of text

## Installation

1. Clone this repository by clicking `Code > Download ZIP` on GitHub
2. Unpack the ZIP file
3. Open Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`
4. Select the `shapekey_warning.py` file in the folder you unzipped
5. Enable the add-on by checking the checkbox next to `Shapekey Warning`. (If the addon does not show up in the list after a few seconds, you might need to install the file inside the zip folder directly in the addons folder located in your blender install : C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender X.X\X.X\scripts\addons)
6. Press the N key in the Viewport to select the Shapekey Warning side-panel and configure it as you wish!

## Usage

1. In the 3D View, open the sidebar (press `N` if not visible) and locate the `Shapekey Warning` tab
2. Edit the settings as you see fit!

## Requirements

- Blender 2.8 or above (functional with 4.0!)
